Run the code like this:

*python face_detect.py abba.png*

If you want to understand how the code works, the details are here:

Update: Now supports OpenCV3. This change has been made by furetosan ( https://github.com/furetosan) and tested on Linux.

To run the OpenCV3 version, run facedetect_cv3.py.

A variational autoencoder for eyes detection, based on pytorch

generally, the binary-cross-entropy loss for a 100*100 pixels eye image of anime characters should be around 0.1-30, simple set the threshold to 30, we are able to classify a 100*100 pixels image to be related with eyes or not
